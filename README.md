## What is it?
Blissely is a full stack, production-ready collaborative bucket list web app developed completely by me. The app features **user authentication** with Google OAuth 2.0 and PassportJS, extensive **authorization flows** which protect routes and block content based on a myriad of considerations for maximum privacy configuration for the user, **CRUD functionality** on a **MySQL** database (hosted on **AWS Aurora**) through **RESTful APIs**, and much, much more.

## Why I built it
I wanted to improve my full stack skills on a scale I had never attempted before. On top of that, I had always wanted to transition from plain JavaScript to TypeScript, so I took this project as an opportunity to learn this superset of JS. Beyond developing new skills, bucket lists are popular and common for people to make, but usually they're meant for the creator only. By offering a bucket list that the creator can share with multiple people, I hope to foster more structured and more convenient event planning between friends and family.
